      <h4>2020: First Chat Online 💌</h4>
      <p>Where it all began. Who knew a simple 'hello' would lead to an inseparable bond? Sometimes I still wonder how fate works—because if it wasn’t for that random coincidence, or maybe someone else unintentionally connecting us, our paths might have never crossed. That first year felt so new, so unexpected, yet so comforting. We didn’t know each other deeply then, but every conversation had a spark, a feeling of ‘this person is special.’ Slowly, day by day, we moved from being strangers to good friends who could talk about random little things, laugh over silly stuff, and share pieces of our lives. It wasn’t about being the closest yet, but it was about finding comfort in each other’s presence, even through a screen. Looking back, I realize that was the year where the foundation of our bond was laid—simple, pure, and innocent… just two souls unknowingly walking towards a beautiful sisterhood.</p>

      <h4>2021: Late Night Talks 🌙</h4>
      <p>If the first year was about finding a friend, then 2021 was the year I found my sister. Somewhere between our endless talks and shared little secrets, I started calling you dii—and trust me, it wasn’t just a word. It carried a meaning so close to my heart that even today it makes me smile. That year we grew closer in a way I never imagined. We didn’t just share our stories, we shared our worlds—our surroundings, our feelings, our family gossip, even our low moments that we rarely show anyone else. You became the person I could lean on without hesitation, the one who understood things I couldn’t even explain properly. That was the time I realized—you weren’t just a friend anymore, you truly meant something to me, someone irreplaceable. 2021 wasn’t just another year, it was the year our bond transformed into something pure, strong, and sisterly forever.</p>

      <h4>2022: Strength in Struggles🌺</h4>
      <p>2022 was a year that tested us in so many ways, but also made our bond unbreakable. I was in my 12th, going through the stress, endless gossips, and those low phases that felt so heavy sometimes… while you were fighting your own battles, taking a drop year for your entrance and facing your own lows. Even though we were in two different worlds, our hearts stayed connected—we shared every little thing, every laugh, every tear, and became each other’s comfort in tough times. What I loved the most was how, no matter what, we stood together. We barely fought, but whenever we did, it hurt both of us deeply. Still, instead of breaking us apart, those moments only proved how much we valued each other. That year showed me that our bond wasn’t fragile, it wasn’t ‘just online.’ It was real, raw, and strong—so strong that we didn’t just call each other sisters, we truly were. 2022 was the year we silently told the world that distance or screens can’t define love… because what we have is far beyond that.</p>

      <h4>2023: My Darkest Year, My Brightest Sister 🌍</h4>
      <p>2023… this year was nothing less than a storm in my life. I had taken a drop, and everything around me felt like it was falling apart. My mom’s health went so low that I felt helpless, I lost one of my closest bonds with my bestest friend Janvhi, and in between all this, I was carrying the burden of JEE preparation too. It was the most drastic phase of my life—so much pain, confusion, and loneliness all at once. And in that darkness, when I felt like I had no one, you stood by me. You became my comfort, my constant, my sister who never left my side no matter how messy things got. I still remember how you always told me, ‘Kanha ji hai na, sab thik ho jayega’—and in those words, I found hope. You were like Kanha ji Himself to me at that time… sent into my life to make things better, to heal my heart, and to remind me that I was not alone. Maybe God knew this stupid girl needed someone truly pure and loving, and that’s why He gave me the most precious gift—a pyaari si behen like you. 2023 wasn’t just a year of pain, it was also the year I realized how blessed I am to have you, my true sister, my light in the dark.</p>

      <h4>2024: Change, Yet the Same Love💜</h4>
      <p>2024 came with even tougher challenges. The result, the family problems, the arguments with Janvhi—everything started to change me as a person. I became different, more closed off, and sometimes even rude. I didn’t always share what I was feeling, but somehow, even from a distance, you understood it all without me saying a word. And that’s when I realized—koi samjhe ya na samjhe, dii hai na. You never judged my change, never stepped back from my side. Instead, you accepted me wholeheartedly—even my rude side was sweet to you. Out of 7.5 billion people in this world, it’s you who understands me the most, and that’s the most precious thing to me. 2024 was also the year I entered college, got busy with my new life, new routine, and all the chaos that came with it. But amidst all that, there was one thing that never changed—you. Your nature, your love, your excitement to wait for my messages, your eagerness to ask, ‘how was my day?’… Dii, I want to tell you this—from the toughest days to the happiest ones, no matter how my day goes, it always ends better after a conversation with you. You’re not just my sister—you’re my peace, my constant, and my biggest blessing.</p>

      <h4>2025: My Forever Sister💖</h4>
      <p>2025 became another turning point in my life, with new people walking in and, of course, new drama too. But through it all, you remained the happiest for me, especially when I stepped into a new relationship. Yes, I know sometimes you might have felt a little jealous because of him—but dii, I want to say this straight from my heart: no matter what, I love you more than anyone else. You are my first and forever sister, my safe space, my constant. I still remember the first time I cried so much because of him… and the only person I thought of telling everything to was you. And as always, you comforted me with such maturity, patience, and love that my heart felt lighter instantly. Every time a problem comes my way, you are still the one I run to. You protect me, you support me, you comfort me—and that’s something no one else can ever replace. This year only proved one thing more clearly: people may come and go, situations may change, but you will always remain my forever sister, the one who holds the biggest piece of my heart.</p>
